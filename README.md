## Description

This is a full-stack MERN application built for a family-owned salon business in Brunei Darussalam. A project to which I will continue to enhance for future use of the business.

Technologies used:
MongoDB - Database
ExpressJS - Node.js web framework
ReactJS - Client-side JavaScript framework
ChakraUI - Component Library

Based on the limit time constraints to this project, I wasn't able to fully implement all the feature to it, including, deleting of appointments, administrative portal where it works as a Content Management System. Listing of Products, Staff, Branches and so on. But this will be touched again or possibly for bigger things to come.

I am always looking for contributors of all skill levels! If you have something in mind to add to the project, try out by [creating an issue](https://github.com/mckinleyvj/fabulous-me/issues) and let's see where we can go from there.
